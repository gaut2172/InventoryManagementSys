# InventoryManagementSys

This is a Java application using a MySQL database. It allows a store's inventory staff to log in securely with a custom role based access control system. Product inventory, customer invoices, manufacturer orders, and product category are the focus of this project. I am incorporating two different versions: one a JavaFX GUI and one a RESTful API with browser-compatible frontend.<br/><br/>
This is a personal project that I have been working on in my free time between school and parenting.
